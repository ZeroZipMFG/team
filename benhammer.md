# About Me

Hi there, my name is Ben Hammer. I enjoy solving problems and making things.

I've worked in the trades for the last 15 years, and learned so much from that.

From a young age, and all throughout my various career paths, art and crafting has stayed a consistent part of my identity.

(Above is just notes for now, will flesh out when I have more time.)
